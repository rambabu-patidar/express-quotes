# express-quotes
ExpressJS application to generate random quotes, also you can add and save your custom quotes. 

I created this mini project while completing the learning of Express, EJS, MVC (Model View Controller), Handeling Routes effectively, getting the form data ( file data and other types of data are not studied yet ),
also didn't implemented any database as I had not learnt that yet.

## Packages I used in this project
- Nodemon - for better development experience and auto reload feature
- Express - a nodejs framework that makes you life easy, everywhere middlewares, haha ( for eg. you don't care about res.end() and res.write() again and again )
- EJS - dynamic html content and  templating engine that nodejs or expressjs already knows about
- body-parser - to parse the data effectively ( and get rid of the storing chunck and then converting them into Buffer and then using it. Ouch it's too much without body-parser)

## Alternate I learnt but not used are
- Pug - simple and easy to use templating engine.
- express-handlebars - good approch of keeping your logic in your application and just use minimal logic in templates

## To run in you local machine follow these steps
- Fork the repository or download the code as zip file and then unzip it
- go into the directory in terminal where you save downloaded files
- do `npm install`
- And run it using `npm start` or `npm run start-server`
- visit localhost:3000 in your browser and you are good to go.
